My code solutions for Coursera's Bioinformatics II course (UC San Diego), "Genome Sequencing". In this course, de Bruijn graphs and Euler's Theorem are used to reconstruct genome sequences from given k-mer compositions. Also, branch and bound algorithms are explored for sequencing cyclopeptides in antibiotics given experimental mass spectrometry data. Algorithms for generating theoretical linear and cyclospectra are implemented here as well.
